## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r libraries}
library(stringr)
```

## 1. Using the 173 majors listed in fivethirtyeight.comâ€™s College Majors dataset [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/], provide code that identifies the majors that contain either "DATA" or "STATISTICS"

In order to find this, I loaded the majors-list.csv directly from fivethirtyeight's github and perform a str_detect on the csv. 

```{r majors}
library(RCurl) 
x <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/majors-list.csv") 
y <- read.csv(text = x)
y

selectedMajors <- y[str_detect(y$Major, "DATA|STATISTICS"), ]
selectedMajors
```

The `r nrow(selectedMajors)` majors that contain either "DATA" or "STATISTICS" are:  
`r str_c(selectedMajors$Major, collapse = ", ")`.  

## 2. Write code that transforms the data below:  

(I do not think I finally understood what the data we are trying to transform is suppose to look like or what typeof it is)

```{r 2}
before <- "bell pepper, bilberry, blackberry, blood orange, blueberry, cantaloupe, chili pepper, cloudberry, elderberry, lime, lychee, mulberry, olive, salal berry"
before

after <- c(str_split(before, ", "))
after
```  

## 3. Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:

a. (.)\1\1 - This expression will match when a character repeats 3 times in a row.

```{r 3a}
str_detect("eee", "(.)\\1\\1")
```    

b. "(.)(.)\\2\\1" - This expression will match when 2 letters and the next 2 letters are the same but flipped. de -> ed

```{r 3b}
str_detect("deed", "(.)(.)\\2\\1")
```  

c. (..)\1 - This expression will match when 2 characters repeat together.

```{r 3c}
str_detect("haha", "(..)\\1")
```  

d. "(.).\\1.\\1" - This expression will match when a character is repeated 3 times with another character in between. (in the example, the a is repeating character separated by n's - bAnAnA)

```{r 3d}
str_detect("banana", "(.).\\1.\\1")
```    

e. "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1" - This expression will match when 3 characters repeat in the reverse order later in the string. (the same as 3b but there can be 0 or multiple characters in between) abcdefcba -> abc _def_ cba

```{r 3e}
str_detect("abcdefcba", "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1")
```   

## 4. Construct regular expressions to match words that:

a. Start and end with the same character: ^(.).*\\1$
```{r 4a}
str_detect("area", "^(.).*\\1$")
```  

b. Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. "church" contains "ch" repeated twice.): (..).*\\1
```{r 4b}
str_detect("chruch", "(..).*\\1")
```   

c. Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. "eleven" contains three "e"s.): (.).*\\1.*\\1
```{r 4c}
str_detect("eleven", "(.).*\\1.*\\1")
```
